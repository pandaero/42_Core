Notes:
libft.a - final
-- .a is an extension signifying static library
libft.h - library
-- must compile functions as objects first
-- .o files called "bricks" in intra videos
-----.o objects get made from compiling just functions without mains (gcc -c option)
-- library composed by using command ar with options/instructions rc (ar rc)

-- gcc -L. | tell gcc to look for a library in the current directory
-- gcc -L -lstr | library string to look for str (?)

-- ranlib
---- creates index in library to access functions more quickly (for when 100s of functions etc. exist)
---- saves time when compiling

Makefile
-- special variables

To Test (static library):
Run test.c using:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra lib.a test.c

size_t - data type defined in several standard libraries - stddef.h is most basic instance

Bus error - attempting to access memory that does not exist.
Segmentation fault - attempting to access memory that is not part of the program calling it.

Void pointer stores a memory address, the memory can contain data of any type.

open a folder in finder using command 'open' in terminal

-- enter directory
----- run using make function for individual functions, or make for all

gitignore wildcard character is: *

Signed integer representations
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_number_representations
-- Sign-magnitude
---- The first bit (sign bit) is completely sacrificed to represent negative sign.
---- The rest of the bits represent the magnitude of the number.
---- It means that 0 and -0 exist.
---- In 4-bit: 0000:0, 0111:7, 1000:-0, 1111:-7
-- Ones' complement
---- The bitwise NOT (complement) corresponds to a negative number.
---- Complement example: 0101 -> 1010 (5 -> -5)
---- Bit-wise, binary addition requires end-around carry at limit.
------ 1110:-1 + 0010:2 = (1) 0000:0, but not correct, carry 1, then 0001:1, correct.
---- In 4-bit: 0000:0, 0111:7, 1000:-7, 1111:-0
-- Two's complement
---- Negative number represented by bitwise NOT (complement), plus 1.
---- No multiple zero. (0 and -0).
---- No end-around carry required.
---- Complement + 1: 0010:2 (neg)-> 1101 + 0001 = 1110:-2
---- In 4-bit: 0000: 0, 0111:7, 1000:-8, 1111:-1

a C Integer type uses the two's complement representation.
Ranges are thus (-2ˆ(n-1)) - (2ˆ(n-1) - 1) where n is the bit-resolution.
-- negative has more range.
