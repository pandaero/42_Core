Notes:
libft.a - final
-- .a is an extension signifying static library
libft.h - library
-- must compile functions as objects first
-- .o files called "bricks" in intra videos
-----.o objects get made from compiling just functions without mains (gcc -c option)
-- library composed by using command ar with options/instructions rc (ar rc)

-- gcc -L. | tell gcc to look for a library in the current directory
-- gcc -L -lstr | library string to look for str (?)

-- ranlib
---- creates index in library to access functions more quickly (for when 100s of functions etc. exist)
---- saves time when compiling

Makefile
-- special variables

To Test (static library):
Run test.c using:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra lib.a test.c

size_t - data type defined in several standard libraries - stddef.h is most basic instance

Bus error - attempting to access memory that does not exist.
Segmentation fault - attempting to access memory that is not part of the program calling it.

Void pointer stores a memory address, the memory can contain data of any type.

open a folder in finder using command 'open' in terminal

-- enter directory
----- run using make function for individual functions, or make for all

gitignore wildcard character is: *
