# Libft

Libft is the first project at 42. It involves creating a library of functions. Some functions come from the standard POSIX functions for string and character manipulation, and others come from 42 definitions.

## stand-alone

This branch is for the version of Libft first created in 42, excluding further project additions (i.e. ft_printf and get_next_line).
