# Libft

Libft is the first project at 42. It involves creating a library of functions. Some functions come from the standard POSIX functions for string and character manipulation, and others come from 42 definitions.

## Standalone-plus

This branch includes the libft bare-minimum, plus any further projects added to libft.
